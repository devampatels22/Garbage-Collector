# Garbage-Collector
The following project implements a simple garbage collector as part of a memory management system. 
The program manages objects using a linked list and two buffers (buff1 and buff2). 
Key functionalities include allocating, tracking, and deallocating memory for objects. 
The garbage collector is capable of compacting memory space by moving objects between buffers. 
The implementation includes features such as reference counting, object insertion, retrieval, and deletion. 
This project demonstrates proficiency in low-level memory management, data structures, and algorithmic considerations. 
The code is designed to be efficient, with garbage collection statistics printed during compaction. 
The implementation utilizes assertions for robustness and includes initialization and cleanup functions for memory pool management. 
This project showcases strong programming skills and a deep understanding of memory management principles.
